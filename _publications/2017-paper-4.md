This publication is the methodological foundation of my proposed theoretical framework for reasoning about generalizability of randomized trials. We introduce a new class of effect measures, the counterfactual outcome state transition (COST) parameters, and show how they can be used to derive results with important implications for meta-analysis and effect heterogeneity.
