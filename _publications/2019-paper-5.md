Here, we provide a new weighting scheme for causal measures of effect. While this is a technical note containing only a minor new result which is subsequently used in a related publication, I believe it demonstrates my ability to write methodological papers in a language that is accessible to non-methodologists; the paper has repeatedly been discussed on social media by applied epidemiologists who wish to understand collapsibility.
