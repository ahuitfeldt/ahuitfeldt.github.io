These parameters can be used to formalize arguments that have arisen multiple times in the statistical literature, beginning with Mindel C. Sheps landmark 1958 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, "Shall we count the living or the dead?". Sheps' arguments have significant implications for external validity and for meta-analysis, and these implications have largely been overlooked in applied statistical practice. I hope that a formal counterfactual model can help facilitate a broader understanding of the scope and limitations of the intuition which Sheps' argument is built upon, so that the implications of this line of reasoning can become an integral part of how evidence is used to inform clinical practice
