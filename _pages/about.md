My primary research interest is to develop causal models for handling external validity and effect heterogeneity. I have proposed a framework based on a new class of effect parameters, the Counterfactual Outcome State Transition parameters. 

These parameters can be used to formalize arguments that have arisen multiple times in the statistical literature, beginning with Mindel C. Sheps landmark 1958 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, "Shall we count the living or the dead?". Sheps' arguments have significant implications for external validity and for meta-analysis, and these implications have largely been overlooked in applied statistical practice. I hope that a formal counterfactual model can help facilitate a broader understanding of the scope and limitations of the intuition which Sheps' argument is built upon, so that the implications of this line of reasoning can become an integral part of how evidence is used to inform clinical practice

From January 2020, I am a Lecturer in Epidemiology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (on a 6-month maternity cover contract). I qualified in medicine at RCSI in 2008, and later obtained a doctoral degree in Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where I worked with the HSPH Program on Causal Inference.
