My research is focused on determining when, whether and how scientific findings can be generalized to populations other than the one that was studied. In particular, I am interested in understanding the factors that predict whether a treatment will be effective in a given patient, and how those factors differ between populations. These considerations play a crucial role in determining how results from randomized trials can be applied in clinical practice, and therefore have high relevance to evidence-based medicine. 

Generalizability of randomized trials has become a ''hot topic" over the last five years, both due to philosophical criticism of the randomized trial as a study design, and also due to innovations in computer science and epidemiologic methodology. My research agenda pursues this topic from a different perspective. With my coauthors, I have proposed a new framework for reasoning about generalizability based on counterfactual models that formalize certain intuitive arguments that have arisen independently multiple times in the earlier literature. For more information, see the "publications" section of this website.

From January 2020, I am a Lecturer in Epidemiology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (on a 6-month maternity cover contract). I qualified in medicine at RCSI in 2008, and later obtained a doctoral degree in Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where I worked with the HSPH Program on Causal Inference.
