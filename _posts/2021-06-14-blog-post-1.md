Today, our new preprint “Shall we count the living or the dead” has been made available on arXiv. This blog post explains the background for this manuscript, and expands on the history of an idea that has been independently rediscovered several times across several different academic fields, yet is not routinely implemented in practice. An animated video explaining a simplified version of the argument has been made available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS1tSeXO_Kk). Today, I am also announcing plans for a documentary about some of the scientists who have independently rediscovered variations of this idea.

Ten years ago, when I was a doctoral student in Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, I had what I then believed was a truly original and important idea about how to choose the scale for measuring the effects of a medication (for example, in randomized trials). 

It quickly became apparent that my idea had been "scooped" more than half a century earlier by [Mindel Cherniack Sheps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindel_C._Sheps) (1913-1973), at the time an Assistant Professor in at Harvard Medical School, later a Professor of Biostatistics at UNC Chapel Hill. In her 1958 paper "Shall we count the living or the dead", Sheps relied on the same intuition as me to reach the same conclusion: That when an intervention reduces the risk of an outcome, the effect should be summarized using the standard risk ratio (which “counts the dead”, i.e. considers the relative probability of the outcome event), whereas when the intervention increases risk, the effect should  instead be summarized using the survival ratio (which “counts the living”, i.e. considers the relative probability of the complement of the outcome event). 

Sheps’ ideas have never been implemented in practice, and most medical statisticians and epidemiologists are unaware of her work. The standard textbook, Modern Epidemiology, mentions Sheps only briefly to dismiss her ideas about effect measures.  

I therefore concluded that I had two important task ahead of me: 

* 	Formalize Sheps’ intuition in terms of a fully specified counterfactual causal model (these models did not exist in 1958)
* Convince methodologists and applied statisticians that this wasn't just a cute idea, but the correct solution to a well-recognized problem with real implications for medical decision making.

I spent the next several years working on this. This research program was not fundable, so I recruited personal friends as collaborators and coauthors; these talented researchers donated their time and efforts towards sharpening the idea, identifying where the argument was unclear and how it could be improved, coming up with examples and improving the structure and flow of the manuscripts. Despite a lot of resistance from reviewers, we were able to publish several papers, yet we are still seeing little progress in terms of getting statisticians and applied medical researchers to actually implement Sheps' solution.

This latest manuscript, which is today available on arXiv, adds the following to the ongoing argument:

* We discuss the  desiderata in choice of effect measure, and clarify why we consider stability to be the central consideration. We show why the typical decision-theoretic argument for using the risk difference fails.  
* The causal model that supports Sheps’ conclusions is presented in terms of Sufficient-Component Cause Models (“Causal Pie Models”), a close variation of Mackie’s INUS framework for causation. 
* This allows us to show that the argument for the stability of the survival ratio is actually an improved version of the argument that is used in some epidemiology courses in favor of the risk difference; and that this argument only works when the intervention increases risk of the outcome
* We clarify the evolutionary reasons for stability of Sheps’ preferred variant of the relative risk. The conclusion depends on a biological asymmetry between levels of the exposure variable, which will generally only be viable when there was a “default state” in evolutionary history (for example: not being treated with Penicillin was the default state for our ancenstors, whereas there was no default state of some other exposure variables, including gender). 
* In the appendix, we provide an impossibility proof for the odds ratio. Specifically, we show that if scientists choose the conditioning set (set of effect modifiers) by reasoning about the distribution of covariates which determine whether an individual will respond to treatment, conditional stability of the odds ratio will only be obtained if the conditioning set is large enough to imply stability of all other measures of effect.

While we were working on this paper, I gradually became aware that variations of the same basic idea have been rediscovered several times across several different academic fields:

* [Patricia Cheng](http://reasoninglab.psych.ucla.edu/PatriciaCheng.html), a psychology professor at UCLA, published the “Power-PC” model in 1997. This model relies on mathematized metaphysical objects called “causal generative and preventive power”. The power-PC model is very closely related to our independently developed causal models, and its recommendations are identical to Sheps’
* Andre Bouckaert and Michel Mouchart, biostatisticians from Universite Catholique de Louvain, developed the [“Sure outcomers of random events”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.659) model in 2001; this model contains mathematical objects that are identical to our models. It has received very little attention, in part because Bouckaert became ill and died shortly after the paper was published, and was therefore not able to accept invitations to promote it at statistical conferences.
*	Rose Baker, an Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics at Salford Business School, and Dan Jackson, a biostatistician at AstroZeneca, developed a new measure of effect for meta-analysis of binary outcomes which they called [“generalized relative risk reduction (“GRRR”)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03471). GRRR automatically selects the variant of the risk ratio recommended by Sheps’.
* Les Irwig and Paul Glasziou, leading thinkers in Evidence-Based Medicine, suggested in [BMJ in 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7496291/) that effects of interventions should be summarized using “relative benefits and additive harms”. While this is technically a different proposal, it will lead to identical predictions if the outcome event is rare. 
* [James Scanlan](http://www.jpscanlan.com), a Harvard-trained  lawyer based in Washington DC, became aware of the asymmetry of the relative risk, while working on related statistal issues in discrimation law. He has written several papers and letters to the editor which point out the impact that this can have on the implications drawn from empirical data. 
* Sainyam Galhotra,  Romila  Pradhan  and  Babak  Salimi are computer scientists working on algorithmic fairness, who recently posted a [pre-print on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11972) which argues that objects called “sufficiency scores” and “necessity scores” can improve on state-of-the-art approaches to algorithm fairness and interpretability. These sufficiency scores and necessity scores are mathematically very close variations of the models that justify Sheps’ argument
*	In response to some of my earlier work, Carlos Cinelli and Judea Pearl, computer scientists at UCLA, developed a [variation of Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00687-4) which uses identical assumptions, and leads to identical conclusions, as the causal models that support Sheps' conclusion. 

Most of these scientists were working without knowledge of any of the others. From this convergence of ideas arising in very different academic traditions, it is clear that there is something about the underlying concepts which attracts people who spend time thinking seriously about models for binary outcomes. We believe it constitutes an attractor in idea space, and that it will continue to be “rediscovered” until it is either explicitly refuted, or routinely implemented in statistical practice.

Today, in addition to the arXiv preprint, I am also announcing plans for a documentary about all the researchers who have rediscovered variations of Sheps’ insight. When travel becomes possible again, a small film crew will follow me across North America and Europe while I have conversations with some of the scientists discussed in this blog post, as well as some of the detractor, and possibly some people who knew Sheps or who have written about other aspects of her life. 

I am personally committing significant financial resources to this project, and will also accept crowdsourced backing via [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/shall-we-count-the-living-or-the-dead-documentary) and Dogecoin (DPZNaH8zCiVAm7irRvAL9gX9ij2uuw3RGk). All contributions (no matter how small) will be acknowledged in the credits; all contributions above $15 will receive a digital copy of the final version of the documentary.
